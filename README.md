# Fruit-tree-target-variable-application-robot
This project aims to complete the 10th International Undergraduate Intelligent Agricultural Equipment Innovation Competition - Category B: Fruit Tree Targeted Variable-Size Pesticide Application Robot (赛题链接：https://uiaec.ujs.edu.cn/news_show.php?id=215). It uses an STM32F407 to receive information from sensors such as gyroscopes, ultrasonic sensors, encoders, and phototubes, and uses this information to control four servo motor coupling devices. It also uses an STM32F103 to receive information from sensors such as cameras and phototubes, and uses this information to control a water pump.
